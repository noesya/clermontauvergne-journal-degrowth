        <p><i>Degrowth</i>&nbsp;is organised as<i>&nbsp;</i>a free, open-access, international, transdisciplinary, and peer-reviewed journal that focuses on advancing the goals of degrowth. It will be published online including open issues and special-issues, and later, rolling submission.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Organised as an international, independent, non-profit association, the editorial collective is decentralised across various countries (e.g. Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK). We meet regularly and operate following the principles of radical democracy. We are currently running without funding and affiliations.</p><p>The active editors of the collective are Sofia Greaves (editor), Sabrina Chakori (founding editor), Peter Sutoris (editor), Eeva Houtbeckers (founding editor), Gerry McCartney (editor), Daniel Chester (editor), Ben Robra (founding editor), and Adrien Plomteux (editor).&nbsp;Other members of the collective are Helene Andersson (copy-editor), Nyma Haqqani (copy-editor),&nbsp;Laura Brackney&nbsp;(copy-editor),&nbsp;Ellen Heimpel&nbsp;(copy-editor), Wiktoria Lopato&nbsp;&nbsp;(copy-editor), Ruby Silk&nbsp;(copy-editor)&nbsp;and Jess Parker (designer).</p><p><i>Degrowth</i>&nbsp;has been made possible by a number of people beyond the editorial board. We would like to express our thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://jessparker.myportfolio.com/">Jess Parker for the graphic designs</a>. The website was made possible by the great people at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noesya.coop/">noesya</a>.&nbsp;We also thank the previous members of the collective: Timoth√©e Parrique (founding editor), Nick Fitzpatrick (founding editor), Enrique Mejia (founding editor), Scott Leatham (editor), and Tor Person (administrator).<br></p>
