        <p><i>October is marigold, and yet<br>A glass half full of wine left out<br><br>To the dark heaven all night, by dawn<br>Has dreamed a premonition<br><br>Of ice across its eye as if<br>The ice-age had begun its heave.<br><br>The lawn overtrodden and strewn<br>From the night before, and the whistling green<br><br>Shrubbery are doomed. Ice<br>Has got its spearhead into place.</i></p><p>- Ted Hughes</p>
