        <p>The transition from a linear to a circular economy (CE) is widely considered as an essential step towards sustainability. The CE is imagined to replace the current take-make-waste model that relies on the continuous input of raw materials from which products are made and then discarded. This model results in the depletion of finite resources, like coal and oil, and causes environmental waste pollution, such as plastic in the oceans and CO2 in the atmosphere. Supposedly, the CE would alleviate these ecological problems by keeping resources circulating in the economy through recycling materials and using renewable energy sources (MacArthur, 2013). The circulation of resources and the elimination of waste not only promises ecological sustainability, but also new business opportunities and economic growth.</p><p>The promise of a win-win scenario makes it an appealing idea, but evaluations of the CE are highly ambivalent. On the one hand, it tends to be popular with mainstream sustainability practitioners such as EU policy-makers. In 2020, the European Commission launched a second CE action plan, which builds upon the first 2015 action plan and is a central part of the European Green Deal (European Commission, 2019b). On the other hand, sustainability scholars tend to be critical of the CE, for instance because it lacks a clear definition, is based on technocratic politics, and fails to address established problems for sustainability such as laws of thermodynamics and the rebound-effect (see Corvellec et al., 2022, for an overview). The CE is being implemented in policy, while it remains conceptually unclear what the CE is and whether it would be desirable — even from the standpoint of sustainability.</p><p>There is thus a need to conceptually study the current EU CE policy. Analyses of the previous EU CE policy have diagnosed shortfalls in the action proposed (Calisto Friant et al., 2021; Kovacic et al., 2019; Leipold, 2021). More conceptual approaches have theorized desirable alternative versions of the CE (Bauwens et al., 2020; Genovese &amp; Pansera, 2021; Hobson, 2016; Veraart &amp; Blok, 2021). But there is a gap in research on the CE which embeds constructive, conceptual criticism within current policy practice.</p><p>In my thesis, I investigate the ecological sustainability of the recent EU CE policy from a conceptual standpoint (Grünsch, 2022). To do so, I employ a synthesized interdisciplinary methodology from the school of policy philosophy. I argue that the CE in the EU constitutes a conceptually incoherent, unstructured policy problem. It is defined as a new, ambitious sustainability agenda, which would fundamentally reshape the relationship between economic and ecological systems, but in practice continues previous technocentric, growth policies. To restructure CE policy and make it more coherent, I reframe the key concepts of circularity and decoupling : rather than recycling, CE should be understood as employing a strong ecomimetic approach to circularity which aims at recoupling economic with ecological systems. This entails socio-ethical transformations and limiting the economy within ecological boundaries. In the next section, I briefly elaborate on my methodological approach, then, I summarize and present some of the outcomes of my analysis, before discussing their wider implication in the last section. </p>
