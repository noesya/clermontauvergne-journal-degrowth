        <p><i>How to bring about social-ecological transformation</i>, the subtitle to <i>Degrowth &amp; Strategy</i> (2022), is a question as ambitious as Lenin’s <i>What is to be done?</i> (1901). Like the revolutionaries of the 20th century, the editors (Nathan Barlow, Livia Regen, Noémie Cadiou, Ekaterina Chertkovskaya, Max Hollweg, Christina Plank, Merle Schulken and Verena Wolf) do not shy away from the task at hand: steering society away from the current polycrisis towards social equity and ecological sustainability. Until now, far more attention has been devoted to <i>what</i> this transformation would resemble rather than <i>how</i> to make it happen. Indeed, degrowth’s reluctance to debate the merits of various means to this end has been termed ‘strategic indeterminance’ (Herbert et al. 2018). <i>Degrowth &amp; Strategy</i> provides the first serious attempt to counter this tendency.</p>
