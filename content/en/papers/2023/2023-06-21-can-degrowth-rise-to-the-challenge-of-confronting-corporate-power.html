        <p><i>How to bring about social-ecological transformation</i>, the subtitle to <i>Degrowth &amp; Strategy</i> (2022), is a question<br>as ambitious as Lenin’s <i>What is to be done ?</i> (1901). Like the<br>revolutionaries of the 20th century, the editors (Nathan Barlow, Livia Regen,<br>Noémie Cadiou, Ekaterina Chertkovskaya, Max Hollweg, Christina Plank, Merle<br>Schulken and Verena Wolf) do not shy away from the task at hand : steering<br>society away from the current polycrisis towards social equity and ecological sustainability.<br>Until now, far more attention has been devoted to <i>what</i> this<br>transformation would resemble rather than <i>how</i> to make it happen. Indeed,<br>degrowth’s reluctance to debate the merits of various means to this end has<br>been termed ‘strategic indeterminance’(Herbert et al. 2018). <i>Degrowth &amp;<br>Strategy</i> provides the first serious attempt to counter this tendency.</p>
