        <p>Degrowth has become a thriving academic field, with several hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and a growing community of thinkers and doers. The field is complex, being not only transdisciplinary, but also bridging science and activism. The topic it studies is not an esoteric concern: the socio-ecological crisis and public frustration with our current economic system has catapulted degrowth to previously unseen heights of engagement. Just after the Covid-19 pandemic shaking the very foundation of how we think our relation to nature and others, there has never been a better time to research degrowth.</p><p>But doing so is not easy. For someone new to the field, gathering key publications is a daunting treasure hunt, with articles scattered over various journals and books. Quite problematically, it is not uncommon to read incoherent depictions of degrowth. For example, one can read about degrowth being compatible with capitalism, or confused with austerity measures.</p><p>Degrowth as a specialised topic deserves its own specialised journal. Degrowth thinkers and doers need an oasis for theoretical work; a place where ideas can be further developed without the need to constantly start from zero making the case for degrowth; a place to voice conceptual conflicts and bring up difficult discussions.</p><p>Therefore we, as a collective of junior scholars, have createdÂ <i>Degrowth</i>, an academic journal dedicated to the subject, where authors will be able to build on each other's work, expanding and strengthening the analytical power of degrowth imaginaries.</p>
