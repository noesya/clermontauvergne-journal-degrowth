        <p>The advent of space mega-trends such as satellite mega-constellations and space tourism have escalated a spatial debris problem. Driven by the arrival of the “New Space”, this revolution is not without consequences for terrestrial and orbital activities, as the world becomes more and more digitized and interconnected. Existing debris coupled with the multiplication of these commercial space launches will progressively hinder future low Earth-orbit utilization. Despite emerging risks awareness, little technical or centralized cooperation has yet emerged in this global common-pool resource. I suggest tackling this issue as a degrowth approach with a preliminary theoretical application, called RCE Model, providing a sustainable solution to obtain both physical and economic access to orbital space, while reducing orbital debris. <br></p>
