        <p>Capitalist<br>agriculture is the major driver for land-system change, as the clearance of<br>forests for cropland and pasture use drives 80 % of global deforestation. It<br>accounts for 70 % of global withdrawals of freshwater. It leads to soil, air and<br>water pollution, and loss of biodiversity, due to the excessive flows of<br>nitrogen and phosphorus, largely caused by agrochemicals use. It is the most<br>significant factor behind the loss of genetic and functional diversity. It<br>heavily contributes to climate change, emitting between the equivalent of 5.0<br>and 5.8 gigatons of CO2 per year in greenhouse gases, between 14 and 24 % of<br>global emissions. (Campbell et al., 2017; Springmann et al., 2018). Moreover,<br>land use change and deforestation to obtain cropland and pastures are the<br>primary causes for the dispossession and displacement of peasants and<br>Indigenous peoples. This condemns communities to poverty, marginalisation and<br>violence (Haiven, 2009; Coulthard, 2014; Federici, 2019). In turn, the removal<br>of people from their ancestral lands causes the loss of place-based knowledge<br>of sustainable agricultural practices and livelihoods (Chatty &amp; Colchester,<br>2008; Fujikane, 2021). These are just a few examples of the devastation caused<br>by capitalist agriculture to ecosystems and their inhabitants.</p><p>Degrowth<br>is an increasingly comprehensive alternative to the capitalist system,<br>especially through the contributions of feminist, decolonial and anticapitalist<br>thinkers (Akbulut, 2021; Dengler &amp; Seebacher, 2019; Gregoratti &amp;<br>Raphael, 2019; Nirmal &amp; Rocheleau, 2019). Given its centrality, the<br>degrowth literature has engaged extensively with the subject of food systems,<br>the interconnected processes and relations involving food production,<br>consumption, sharing, distribution, disposal and governance (Vermeulen et al.,<br>2012, p. 197). These works provide inspiring proposals and examples of food<br>systems following degrowth principles (Fehlinger et al., 2022; Infante Amate<br>&amp; González de Molina, 2013; McGreevy et al., 2022; Nelson &amp; Edwards,<br>2022; Plank, 2022, pp. 202-206). Nevertheless, degrowth has engaged to a lesser<br>extent with agriculture, as a specific aspect of food production (Gerber, 2020;<br>Gomiero, 2018, p. 1825). Moreover, this collection approach, while providing an<br>overview of existing alternatives, often lacks an extensive critique of the<br>capitalist and productivist agricultural system it counters. Such a critique is<br>fundamental to avoid capitalist co-optation of the movement, and to propose a<br>comprehensive vision for a degrowth-based alternative, for example to operate<br>beyond the local scale and broaden its pool for transformational strategies<br>(Guerrero Lara et al., 2023, pp. 8-9; Plank, 2022, p. 205).</p><p>In<br>this essay, I address these gaps by engaging in a dialogue between degrowth and<br>some authors in critical theory and eco-Marxism. The literature synthesising<br>Marxism and degrowth is very rich and is lately becoming increasingly relevant.<br>Many degrowth scholars have provided critiques to the capitalist system, mostly<br>focusing on its compulsion for growth and its devastating socioecological<br>consequences (Akbulut, 2021; Dengler &amp; Struck, 2018; Hickel, 2021; Kallis<br>et al., 2014, pp. 10-11; Schmelzer et al., 2022). Some scholars have employed<br>Gramscian theory to better define the role of the state in degrowth strategy<br>(D’Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020; Koch, 2022), while others have called for an<br>eco-socialist degrowth (Akbulut, 2021; Barca, 2019; Kallis, 2019; Löwy et al.,<br>2022). Matthias Schmelzer et al. (2022), in particular, lay out a comprehensive<br>picture of what degrowth is in relation to the capitalist system and all the<br>other interconnected systems of oppression, allowing for a comprehensive<br>outline of fields of action (Schmelzer et al., 2022).</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>In<br>this essay, I pick up on this method. I focus on how a structural critique of<br>agriculture within capitalism and interrelated systems of oppression, can help<br>in defining fields of action for a degrowth-based alternative agriculture. In<br>the next section, I will present the theory of capitalism as an institutionalised<br>social order and provide a critique of capitalist agriculture according to this<br>framework. Following these reflections, in the second section I identify some<br>priorities for a degrowth agriculture in the fields of land redistribution and<br>regeneration, resurgence of regenerative agricultural knowledge systems, and<br>more equal global trade relations. I conclude by summarising my argument, and<br>by indicating care ethics and practices as a way to frame a degrowth-based<br>agriculture.<br></p>
