        <p>Any conception of a degrowth society requires a fundamental change in our communal<br>definition of existence. For centuries, we have upheld a Cartesian view of reality : an<br>irreducible duality between mind and matter, body and soul, enshrined in Descartes’famous<br>dictum <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i> (I think, therefore I am). This conception of existence has placed<br>humanity among an external, material environment and has rationalized the conversion of<br>this environment for resources, production, and profit. Our long-held perception of dualism<br>has enabled the capitalist machine to grow and sprawl unabated, leading us to the crossroads<br>we now lie at, facing food shortages, energy crises, and ecological collapse.<br></p><p>The capitalist ethos is built around an inherent pursuit of growth for growth’s sake and pits<br>individuals against each other, spurred on by the necessity to consume or perish. Its systemic<br>pervasiveness means that the solutions to these imminent crises must address the very<br>frameworks within which the problems are embedded. The transition to a degrowth economy<br>must begin with a collective reimagination of what it means to be human. </p><p>Where then do we begin ? How can we do away with the growth-centric paradigms that<br>govern our everyday decisions ? Can we break free from the structures that create these<br>choices ? We may be able to draw some inspiration from the philosophies and cosmologies of<br>the Indigenous peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. <br><br></p>
