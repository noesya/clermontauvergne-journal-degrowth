        <p>Degrowth points to the need for a radical transformation of the economic system if humanity is to avoid the existential risk of wide-ranging ecological collapse. It stresses that the imperative of growth, which is so fundamental to most modern societies, is at the root of the intertwined ecological, social and economic crises of the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. Therefore, any realistic strategy of addressing the ongoing planetary ecocide will need to tackle the issue of 'economic' growth - how do we stop it while ensuring well-being and flourishing for all of humanity? Doing so through minor adjustments within the current capitalist world-system seems improbable, if not impossible (Akbulut, 2021). This has led to the conclusion, popularised amongst others by degrowth scholars, that a radically different economic system is needed.</p><p>While the implications concerning <i>economic</i> systems coming out of degrowth scholarship are quite clear, this cannot be said for the implications concerning <i>political</i> systems. In fact, degrowth scholarship often promotes (minor) adjustments to existing political structures under the label of 'non-reformist reforms' (Petridis et al., 2015). These are considered intermediary steps towards more far-reaching social-ecological transformations. The general prevalence of this approach can be ascertained from the fact that around three-quarters of degrowth proposals consist of top-down policies with a national focus (Cosme et al., 2017).</p><p>Recently the (anglophone) academic degrowth literature has started to engage with the question of what kind of state (if any) is required for a degrowth transformation. Much of this engagement has focused on the Gramscian theory of the 'integral state' (D'Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020), which conceptualises the state as comprising both <i>political</i> society (army, police, political institutions) and<i> civil</i> society (organisations, trade unions, and even families). As Herbert et al. (2021) note, the integral state theory 'subsumes all social activity<i> within</i> "the state", and by extension precludes the existence of spaces and relations "outside" the state', thus potentially obfuscating certain strategies and traditions of anti-capitalist resistance. Alternatively, anarchist conceptualisations of the state distinguish between the hierarchical institutions that control the monopoly of violence in modern societies (the state proper), and other institutions and norms that organise social interactions but do not have a claim on the legal use of violence (society at large). Such a distinction allows anarchist thinkers to keep a firm focus on the violent processes by which modern states have been formed, and which continue to be an indispensable condition for their survival (Kropotkin, 1910). Moreover, the anarchist theoretical outlook concludes that the root cause of the social and ecological crises that we are facing lies precisely in the hierarchical and violent subjugation of certain groups of people by others (Bookchin, 2015). Consequently, addressing these crises and initiating degrowth transformation would require the wholesale dismantling of these violent structures of domination that have become institutionalised over time - in other words, the dismantling of the state (political society) as we know it.</p><p>Nonetheless, degrowth scholarship has also stressed the need for any social-ecological transformation to be radically democratically led, and for democracy to be deepened in the process. Direct democracy has long been lauded as part and parcel of the politics of degrowth (Asara et al., 2013; Cattaneo et al., 2012; Deriu, 2012). Others have gone further and claimed that, because of the magnitude of changes that degrowth transformations require, they will necessarily have to be based on anarchistic principles, largely abandoning hierarchical statist structures (Trainer, 2012). More generally, there seems to be broad recognition of the fact that degrowth challenges hierarchical, centralised and representative democracy, and as such it is broadly aligned with (ecological) anarchist thought and ethos (Toro, 2017; D'Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020).</p><p>While the francophone degrowth literature has long acknowledged this alignment, and therefore extensively analysed the question of the state and anarchism in relation to degrowth, the anglophone literature has only recently started recognising the deep links between degrowth and anarchism. For example, Finley (2019) has looked at the connections and discrepancies between degrowth and social ecology (a branch of libertarian socialism closely related to anarchism) and found these two theoretical frameworks to be by-and-large compatible, with the potential for social ecology to fortify the degrowth analysis with its more thorough insistence on non-hierarchical epistemologies. Gerber (2020) demonstrated the fruitfulness of combining degrowth and anarchism when it comes to connecting the 'growth question' to peasant movements and the 'agrarian question', while Grubačić et al. (2022) reached a similar conclusion regarding the issue of land (ownership) more generally. Finally, Dunlap (2020) acknowledges the connection between 'degrowth and anti-capitalist, autonomist and (ecological) anarchist movements', and calls for these connections to be strengthened through degrowth intellectuals and advocates recognising the legitimacy of combative struggles against 'growth' (infrastructure) projects. What emerges from these discussions is that the implications regarding future political systems that degrowth scholarship espouses are somewhat ambiguous. While some advocate for 'non-reformist reforms', others argue that the rejection of hierarchical statist structures is a prerequisite for any viable social-ecological transformation. In other words, even though the dominant degrowth position does not generally align with the anarchist rejection of the state, there are deep intellectual linkages between these two anti-capitalist currents, and interest seems to be growing in further exploring and elaborating the connections between them. Following from this logic, we feel that it is necessary for degrowth to engage more explicitly with other anti-capitalist movements, particularly those that are not often comprehensively treated in degrowth scholarship and advocacy. These movements can be broadly categorised as anarchistic because of their rejection of hierarchical structures and their commitment to building alternative (political) institutions capable of supporting socially just and ecologically sustainable communities and societies.</p><p>          </p><p>If, as we argue, degrowth implies a complete transformation of political systems (alongside economic ones), then it is of vital importance to start drawing lessons from movements that align with values and goals that degrowth advocates for. These movements are actively enacting alternative political systems on the ground and have been doing so for a long time. In the remainder of this article, we present the processes and outcomes of our efforts to learn from such anti-capitalist movements, while organising a thematic stream at the 8th International Degrowth Conference in The Hague.</p>

      2. Organising an ‘anarchist stream’ at the 2021 International Degrowth Conference
    position: 2

      text: >-
        <p>Given the pre-eminence of International Degrowth Conferences in forming and promoting the degrowth agenda, as well as in advancing debates and resolving points of contention within the movement (Rilović et al., 2022), we chose one such conference as a strategically important forum for advancing the discussion on the links between degrowth and anarchism. In particular, following Dunlap's (2020) call, we focused on engaging with anti-capitalist movements that can be broadly categorised under the 'anarchist umbrella' (even though some do not necessarily self-identify as such). Our aim was to discover what such movements could teach degrowth scholars and activists with regards to advancing an anti-capitalist agenda that tackles the ongoing capitalist ecocide while simultaneously creating emancipatory social conditions.</p><p>As part of the local organising committee of the 8<sup>th</sup> International Degrowth Conference in The Hague (2021), we believed it was fundamental to give a central place to anarchism, both in our organisation processes (practices of autonomy, horizontalism, decentralisation and affinity groups) and in the conference content. This is why we proposed 'Degrowth and Anarchism' as one of the conference's eight thematic streams, the other ones being Decoloniality, Urban-Rural Dialogues, Green New Deals, Feminist Political Ecology, Dutch Social Movements, Cultural Politics and Embodying Degrowth. Having anarchism as a central theme in the conference was intended both as an affirmation and a provocation. First, it is an affirmation in its assertion that degrowth is not only about green new deals, top-down policy measures and institutional reforms, but also about direct action, autonomous movements building concrete (political) alternatives and the material disruption of capitalist destruction. Second, it is a provocation in the sense that it acknowledges real tensions in the degrowth movement between statist and anti-statist positions (see the plenary debate at the 6<sup>th</sup> International Degrowth Conference in Malmö, also see Eversberg &amp; Schmelzer, 2018) and strives to engage productively with these tensions without compromising on principles, nor neglecting historical disagreements.</p><p>During the last week of August 2021, a variety of panel discussions, presentations, movie screenings and debates about degrowth and anarchism took place either online, in one of the decentralised conference venues, or around late-night beers - celebrating the renewed possibility of being able to meet in person after more than a year of pandemic restrictions. More broadly, critiques of the nation-state echoed all throughout the conference's different thematic streams: the nation-station was explained to be a sustained colonial project, a totalising project that cannot be disentangled from capitalism, imperialism and extractivism. Moreover, the nation-state was considered heteropatriarchal and violent in systemic, institutional and very physical ways, while at the same time manifesting the very negation of 'real' democracy. Needless to say, these are all basic premises of anarchism. <br></p>

      3. Plenary session on degrowth and anarchism
    position: 3

      text: >-
        <p>There is a lot of talk within the degrowth movement about its purported anarchist roots and influences. Degrowthers refer to the Zapatistas, to Rojava and to other autonomous zones as sources of inspiration and hope. Yet, these examples are often dealt with superficially, and without taking their history and the particularities of their struggles into account. This is exactly what we intended to counteract during the 'Anarchism and Degrowth plenary' on the conference's last day. We were not particularly interested in 'explaining' degrowth's compatibility with anarchism, nor in hypothesising what Bakunin would have thought about the degrowth movement. Instead, we wanted to cherish and foster the diversity of positions that exist in degrowth by bringing in anarchist positions and exploring how they could resonate with existing degrowth practices and with those that could emerge in the future.</p><p>  </p><p>Engaging with anarchism, here and now, means enabling concrete discussions about the strategies and lived experiences oforganising inside, outside, against and beyond both the state and capitalism, along with all their contradictions, ambiguities and messiness. For this, we invited four very inspiring persons who organise with and critically reflect on autonomous movements from the Zapatistas in Chiapas, the Kurdish movement in Rojava and beyond, the squatting movement in the Netherlands and the ZAD (Zone to Defend) in Notre-Dames-des-Landes (France). We were very grateful to have Jorge Durán Solórzano, Teun Zwartstaart and Isa Fremeaux join us in person in The Hague, while Dilar Dirik called in from the UK. We asked them what political strategies exist in these places; what their experiences are with autonomous organising in diverse ecologies, institutional settings and historical contexts; and what degrowthers could learn from these diverse movements. In the next section we will summarise the positions and teachings of our invited speakers.</p>

      4. A diversity of struggles for autonomy

        <p><b>Jorge </b>shared with us the little-known historical emergence of the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberación National (EZLN). He explained how the transformation of the Fuerzas de Liberación Nacional (FLN) to EZLN consisted essentially of a metamorphosis from a traditional Marxist-Leninist vanguard guerrilla movement towards an anti-authoritarian military organisation that was not only influenced by, but also comprised of, indigenous peasant communities. In the early 1990s, the EZLN instituted a variety of revolutionary laws, amongst which were the revolutionary women's law, the urban reform law and the law on the rights and obligations of the peoples in struggles. The revolutionary women's law, considered a revolution within the revolution, stipulates that women have 'the right to participate in the revolutionary struggle in the place and to the degree that their will and capacity determine', as well as that women 'may hold leadership positions in the organisation and have military ranks in the revolutionary armed forces'. The urban reform law established the possibility to occupy empty public buildings and recover property, while the law on the rights and obligations of the people in struggle established the right of every community to freely and democratically elect local authorities and excluded the revolutionary armed forces from intervening in matters of civil order.</p><p>Jorge's intervention showed precious insights in the socio-political context leading to the 1994 Zapatista uprising. The long process of forming an indigenous peasant army showed that Marxist-Leninist vanguardism was neither adequate nor desirable for fostering true social revolution, let alone for establishing and democratically running a territory. Marxist-Leninist vanguardism has proved insufficient in Mexico already since the 1970s, Jorge explained. This highlights the importance of changing political strategies in the light of changing contexts. Similarly, it gives additional historical backing to the assertion that the establishment of new institutions and practices should be part and parcel of any revolution - not something to be implemented 'after the revolution' by a party, an army or a central committee.</p><p><b>Dilar</b> explained the workings and ideological positions of the Kurdish transnational movement, and focused on the women's liberation movement. This women's movement lies at the heart of the revolution in Rojava and its international support in the Kurdish diaspora. In her presentation, she drew on the movement's ideological concepts which are mainly articulated by movement leader and political prisoner Abdullah Öcalan. Dilar reminded us that the nation-state is an imposed colonial construct, but that this structure of domination should not merely be considered in the 'short' historical time frame of what we are used to call colonialism. Rather, the movement identifies a 5000-year-old history of state civilisation, beginning with the rise of early Sumerian states and the progressive consolidation and institutionalisation of hierarchical structures. Confronting and overcoming state violence comes with the nourishing of alternative political projects such as self-governance in Kurdistan and the broader Middle East and the transnational confederal organising of the diaspora in Europe, along with broad-based internationalist coalition-building. The Kurdistan freedom movement revolves around women's liberation, radical democracy and ecology, and aims to recover those aspects of social life that were surrendered to the state, patriarchy and capitalism.</p><p>The women's liberation movement emerged in parallel with the progressive dissociation from the nation-state: since the 1990s, women are organising autonomous spaces in order to articulate their own terms of struggle. This is based on the 'women's liberation ideology', which is built on the following principles: (1) women's love for the homeland (not a reactionary nationalism, but care for the land and the territory); (2) 'free thought and free will', i.e. developing own forms and structures of thinking to free the movement from suffocating '-isms'; (3) autonomous organising to be less vulnerable to attacks; (4) the importance of struggle and resistance to realise emancipatory visions; and (5) creating own visions of beauty and aesthetics. In parallel, new forms of women's internationalism have emerged that struggle against global patriarchy. Dilar ended her inspiring discourse with a call to degrow our reliance on the state, to grow autonomous communities with capacities for physical and mental self-defence, and to foster women's movements not as an add-on to other struggles, but as an autonomous force of its own within a connected web of emancipatory struggles.</p><p><b>Teun </b>shared his lived experiences in the Dutch squatting movement that aims to create and maintain autonomous zones in and beyond the city through the occupation of empty buildings and plots of land. He explained how increased police repression and anti-squatting laws have made squatting more difficult in recent years, with two main consequences: the normalisation of short occupations and the invisibilisation of squatting. When you get evicted every other month, squatting becomes very draining and leaves little room for connections to other political struggles. Similarly, because squatting is pushed outside of the city centre, people don't see it as a possible way of life, which means that the movement does not grow and risks becoming self-centred. These two tendencies have created a vicious cycle and a reduced potential for squats and free zones to be spaces and incubators for political action, as they have been historically.</p><p>Squats do remain important spaces for degrowthers because of their anti-capitalist ways of organising, their propagation of a DIY-culture, their links to other social movements and the different solidarity initiatives they are part of (such as Solidarity Kitchens). Fundamentally, squats reject and dismantle the very motor of capital accumulation: private property (Kraakdecrisis, 2020). They promote forms of communal living in a highly individualised consumerist society, and other ways of relating to (and taking advantage of) urban infrastructures and the built environment (see also Cattaneo, 2018). For Teun, squatting is about reviving the idea of being proper political subjects, and this idea should be cultivated beyond the sometimes-pragmatic vision of living rent-free. The housing crisis has been getting ever worse in the Netherlands, which has led to the organisation of dozens of housing protests all over the country and a renewed momentum for squatting as well as the assertion of its inherently political nature. Various new squats have sprouted, and the 'squatting info hour' has become a sort of squatting service, helping out new groups to occupy new places, and notably setting up FLINTA*-squats. In reaction to these new developments and the recent growth of the movement, Teun has seen repression increasing too. He considers this to be an affirmation of the good work the squatting movement has been doing and the fear it has managed to instil into the authorities.</p><p><b>Isa </b>shared with us her personal experience of living at la ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes and their sustained struggle against the construction of a new airport near Nantes. For decades, activists, farmers and residents in the <i>bocage</i> in the West of France have resisted not only the construction of this airport, but also rejected 'the world that comes with it'. In the early 2000s, an open letter invited people to squat, inhabit and defend the territory that was threatened by government plans, and it steadily became a huge autonomous zone and source of inspiration for activists all over Europe. In 2012, the French government launched a big military operation to evict the squatters and clear the zone but was met with strong resistance and a great diversity of tactics to push back police forces. During this military operation, a 'Reoccupation Demonstration' mobilised 40,000 people to rebuild what had been destroyed during the first days of the operation. Consequently, police withdrew for six years, during which people on the one hand autonomously organised to resist capitalist expansion and state eviction and, on the other, created ways of being and living collectively that are more egalitarian, respectful to the different life-forms living in the zone and rooted in the specific ecologies of the place. Isa moved to the ZAD in 2016 and explained that autonomy is progressively being constructed through diversified agricultural production, collective assemblies, the creation of spaces of resistance and, more generally, the building of commons.</p><p>              </p><p>After the government announcement to cancel the airport project in January 2018, a new military operation was launched. This was interpreted by local residents as a punishment for having shown that autonomy is possible. After new evictions and the destruction of various homes, the French government tried to undermine the ZAD's autonomy and commoning projects in more bureaucratic ways, by obliging residents to develop individual projects and sign land-use contracts with the local government. This government strategy has created tension in the movement, and in response a strategy was developed to 'hack' the government's individual forms so as to enable all those who wished to stay to do so. As such, the movement reaffirmed a collective vision that shows the entanglements of all the different activities and life-forms that co-exist in the ZAD. Those collectives or individuals that refused to sign government contracts were once again considered 'illegal squatters'. They were evicted from the zone and their houses were destroyed. While surely the legal status of the ZAD has changed in the last years, Isa enthusiastically explained that it remains a laboratory for autonomously building the commons, and, importantly, that there will never be an airport built there because of the determination and creativity of people in struggle.</p>
