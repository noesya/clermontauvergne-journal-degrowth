  Degrowth, as an academic field, has been connected to many other fields, topics, and discourses
---
Degrowth, as an academic field, has been connected to many other fields, topics, and discourses. It is a thriving field with several hundreds peer-reviewed publications. Yet, thus far it is lacking its own specialised journal. We believe that a journal with a focus on degrowth will help to further empirically and theoretically develop the field without the need to always start from zero or connect it to another specialised topic. We talk more about our reasoning in the journal’s manifesto here.<br><br>Welcome to the journal <em>Degrowth</em> and its first open call for contributions. <em>Degrowth</em> is an open-access, international, transdisciplinary peer-reviewed journal that focuses on contributions in and around the topic of degrowth. The journal will be published online following calls for open issues and special-issues, and later, rolling submission. Articles will be published online on a rolling basis, without having to wait for a full and complete issue. For the inaugural issue of the journal, we are looking for contributions that contribute to degrowth scholarship. That is contributions can include but are not limited to:<br><br> <ul> <li>Debates in and around degrowth</li> <li>Critical reflections</li> <li>Marginalised and subaltern perspectives</li> <li>The application of degrowth in different areas</li> <li>Interactions between degrowth and other concepts and fields</li> <li>Empirical work relating to degrowth</li> <li>Conceptual and theoretical work</li> <li>Systematic reviews, bibliometric analyses, and reflections about the existing literature on degrowth and related studies </li> </ul>We are looking for contributions in the following formats:<br><br> <ul> <li> <strong>Peer-reviewed Research Articles</strong> –  up to 10.000 words in length (excl. references). Research articles are expected to be novel research of high quality. Articles are expected to make new contributions to degrowth research, build on the corpus of degrowth literature and/or connect to other bodies of literature in novel ways, be evidently strong and develop clear themes and arguments. These articles can draw on several methods and approaches. Articles are either double-blind peer reviewed or non-blind peer reviewed. Authors can request a non-blind peer review by submitting their work non-blinded, peer reviewers are then encouraged to also sign their peer review with their name. </li> <li> <strong>Book Reviews </strong>– 700-1.000 words in length (excl. references). Book reviews provide a critical evaluation of emerging literature from the broad research field of degrowth. These might also include (but not limited to) related topics such as post-growth and ecological economics. Reviewed by editor(s).</li> <li> <strong>Thesis Presentations</strong> – 1.500-3.000 words in length (excl. references). Thesis presentations provide Masters and PhD students with the possibility to summarise and present their recently published degrowth related research thesis.
