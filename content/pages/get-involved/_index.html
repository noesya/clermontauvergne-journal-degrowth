  <p>A journal is like a community garden, and there is no community garden without gardeners. That’s where you come in. <br><br>First, <b>we’re looking for writers</b>: researchers sharing their latest scientific discoveries or their perspectives about specific issues; thinkers wishing to share their exploration of a topic in an essay; book worms eager to write a review of their latest read; students excited to summarise their theses; doers who have a story to tell about a conference, a meeting, or anything else they feel might be relevant to the readers of this journal. This is a safe place to grow wild ideas; don’t hesitate to submit.  <br><br>Second, <b>we’re inviting experts to review papers</b>. Do you have expertise in a topic that relates to degrowth? If yes, get in touch; we’re building a database of researchers in all career stages to take part in the review process. <br><br>Third, <b>we want to engage readers in the discussion</b>. Did you find a piece particularly engaging? If you’re willing to write a commentary, we’ll be happy to consider it for publication. <br><br>Finally, <b>we are continuously looking for scholars to become editors. </b>We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply; and especially people that are currently underrepresented in academia. As of now, our publishing capacity is very limited because we are only a few, but the more editors join us, the more papers we will be able to review. We are also open to new additions for <b>new people to help us run the journal </b>in an administrative capacity.</p><p>Just get in touch with us if you are interested (<a href="mailto:info@degrowthjournal.org">info@degrowthjournal.org</a>).</p><p>The journal is run without funding, hence all work for the journal is on an voluntary basis.</p>
